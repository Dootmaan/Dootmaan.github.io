  description: In this paper we propose a low-cost 3D segmentation framework which can realize HR segmentation with LR input. Thus, patch-sampling is no longer needed and the model can have the global context when training. Experiments show that our model outperforms patch-based methods with a 4x higher speed.

  description: In this paper we propose a new Vision Transformer module to simutaneously model local and global dependecies. The self-attention is split into fine-grained local SA and coarse-grained global SA with a gaussian mask further added on it. Experiments show that our model achieved sota performance on two datasets.

  description: In this paper we propose a simple yet efficient pure-MLP multimodal fusion technique named CubeMLP. CubeMLP fuses the multimodal input in sequence, modality and channel dimensions repectively, achieving SOTA performance on CMU-MOSI, CMU-MOSEI and AVEC2019 with a much lower complexity.

  description: This paper is the extended version of our MICCAI 2021 paper. The main improvements include a selective cropping algorithm for HR guidance patch, the use of multi-scale encoders, and test-time refinement based on the existing LR-HR image pair. This paper is finished in January 2022.

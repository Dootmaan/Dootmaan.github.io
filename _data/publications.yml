  description: In this paper we propose a low-cost 3D segmentation framework which can realize HR segmentation with LR input. Thus, patch-sampling is no longer needed and the model can have the global context when training. Experiments show that our model outperforms patch-based methods with a 4x higher speed.

  description: In this paper we propose a new Vision Transformer module to simutaneously model local and global dependecies. The self-attention is split into fine-grained local SA and coarse-grained global SA with a gaussian mask further added on it. Experiments show that our model achieved sota performance on two datasets.

  description: In this paper, we propose to solve the information propagation gap between the embedder and classifier in MIL with an iteratively coupled method. This elegant method view the entire MIL pipeline as an EM optimization problem, and is highly generalizable. We adopt ICMIL on different MIL backbones and achieved consistent improvements. The main branch of the repository holds the code for this method.

  description: In this extended journal version of ICMIL, we propose to use the instance aggregator in MIL backbones to generate confidence score for each instance's pseudo label, thereby improving the effectiveness of the embedder fine-tuning. A bag-level augmentation method is also added for the MIL training to realize a even higher performance. Check our code in the alternative branch of the repository.

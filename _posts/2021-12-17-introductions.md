Hello, my name is Hongyi and this website is used as my personal page to post new information or blogs. You can find my related publications in the header->more->publications. You can ask any questions about my works through any channel I provide publicly (such as leaving a comment under a blog or directly contacting me through SNS).

I love watching movies, playing video games (Dota2 mostly rn), and traveling. Under the current pandemic, we have to stay at home for safety, which gives me a lot of time for building up my profiles. 

Some of my previous blogs are posted at https://www.cnblogs.com/dotman/ in Chinese and you are also welcome to visit them. However, my blogs in the future will only be posted on THIS website.

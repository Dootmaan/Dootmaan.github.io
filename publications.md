# 1. Patch-Free 3D Medical Image Segmentation Driven by Super-Resolution Technique and Self-Supervised Guidance
In this paper we propose a low-cost 3D segmentation framework which can realize HR segmentation with LR input. Thus, patch-sampling is no longer needed and the model can have the global context when training. Experiments show that our model outperforms patch-based methods with a 4x higher speed.

# 2. Mixed Transformer U-Net For Medical Image Segmentation
In this paper we propose a new Vision Transformer module to simutaneously model local and global dependecies. The self-attention is split into fine-grained local SA and coarse-grained global SA with a gaussian mask further added on it. Experiments show that our model achieved sota performance on two datasets.
